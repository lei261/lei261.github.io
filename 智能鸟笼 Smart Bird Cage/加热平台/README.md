这个项目的来源是因为有一款看起来不错的产品, K&H 加热站杆，有不少好评，个人感觉也确实有用。但因为该产品温度不稳定的原因，评论两级分化，差评一般分为（不够热，摸上去没感觉；过热，鹦鹉低温烫伤）。作为用户，我也不知道他实时温度是多少，我的初衷是基于做一个温度更稳定，并能显示温度的产品。

The idea of this project comes from an exsiting product, K&H thermal perch, which is a pretty good idea IMO. However, its reviews have been either extremely good or extremely poor, mostly due to its inconsistent temperature. In the low star reviews, consumers are complaining either product is not warm enough, or product is too hot that it burned a concure's feet. As a user, I don't know what the temperatue is at any given time. So the purpose of this project is to make one that is more stably controlled and can display temperature.
