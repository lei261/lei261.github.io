这个项目的来源是因为有一款看起来不错的产品, K&H 加热站杆，有不少好评，个人感觉也确实有用。但因为该产品温度不稳定的原因，评论两级分化，差评一般分为（不够热，摸上去没感觉；过热，鹦鹉低温烫伤）。我的初衷是基于该产品做一个温度更稳定的版本。
The idea of this project comes from an exsiting product, K&H thermal perch, which is a great idea and product, IMO. However, its reviews have been either extremely good or extremely poor, mostly due to its inconsistent temperature. In the low star reviews, consumers are complaining either product is not warm enough, or product is too hot that it burned a concure's feet. So the purpose of this project is to make a more thermally stable version of the K&H thermal perch.
